#Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-UI
Overview:

This Flask application demonstrates a robust authentication and authorization system, leveraging JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure token-based authentication.

Key Features:

User Registration: Allows users to create new accounts with strong password hashing.
User Login: Authenticates users using secure password comparison.
Session Management: Manages user sessions using Flask-Session.
JWT-Based Authentication: Issues JWT tokens for secure access to protected resources.
Role-Based Access Control: Implements role-based access control to restrict access to specific routes.
Error Handling: Handles authentication and authorization errors gracefully.
Installation:

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-auth-example.git
Use code with caution.

Create a virtual environment:
Bash
python -m venv venv
Use code with caution.

Activate the virtual environment:
Bash
venv\Scripts\activate 1  Â  
1.
github.com
github.com
  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Create a secret_key.py file:
Python
flask_secret_key = 'your_flask_secret_key'
jwt_secret_key = 'your_jwt_secret_key'
Use code with caution.

Run the application:
Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.

Usage:

Register a new user:
Access the registration page.
Fill in the required details.
Submit the form to create a new account.
Login:
Access the login page.
Enter your credentials (username and password).
Submit the form to log in.
Access Protected Routes:
Once logged in, you can access protected routes.
The application will check the user's role and permissions to determine access.
Security Considerations:

Password Hashing: Uses strong password hashing algorithms like bcrypt.
Session Management: Implements secure session management.
JWT Security: Uses a strong secret key for JWT signing and considers additional security measures like token expiration and revocation.
Input Validation: Sanitizes and validates user input to prevent attacks.
HTTP-Only Cookies: Sets the HttpOnly flag for session and JWT cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
HTTPS: Encrypts communication between the client and server.
